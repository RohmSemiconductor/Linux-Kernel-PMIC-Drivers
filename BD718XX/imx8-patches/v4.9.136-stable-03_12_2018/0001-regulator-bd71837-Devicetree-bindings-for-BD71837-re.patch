+ROHM BD71837 Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) regulator bindings
+
+BD71837MWV is a programmable Power Management
+IC (PMIC) for powering single-core, dual-core, and
+quad-core SoC’s such as NXP-i.MX 8M. It is optimized
+for low BOM cost and compact solution footprint. It
+integrates 8 Buck regulators and 7 LDO’s to provide all
+the power rails required by the SoC and the commonly
+used peripherals.
+
+Required properties:
+ - regulator-name: should be "buck1", ..., "buck8" and "ldo1", ..., "ldo7"
+
+List of regulators provided by this controller. BD71837 regulators node
+should be sub node of the BD71837 MFD node. See BD71837 MFD bindings at
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd71837-pmic.txt
+Regulator nodes should be named to BUCK_<number> and LDO_<number>. The
+definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard
+binding for regulators at
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
+Note that if BD71837 starts at RUN state you probably want to use
+regulator-boot-on at least for BUCK6 and BUCK7 so that those are not
+disabled by driver at startup. LDO5 and LDO6 are supplied by those and
+if they are disabled at startup the voltage monitoring for LDO5/LDO6 will
+cause PMIC to reset.
+
+The valid names for regulator nodes are:
+BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK3, BUCK4, BUCK5, BUCK6, BUCK7, BUCK8
+LDO1, LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDO6, LDO7
+
+Optional properties:
