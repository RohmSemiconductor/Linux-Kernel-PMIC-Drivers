-BD71837MWV is a programmable Power Management IC for powering single-core,
-dual-core, and quad-core SoCs such as NXP-i.MX 8M. It is optimized for
-low BOM cost and compact solution footprint. It integrates 8 Buck
-egulators and 7 LDOs to provide all the power rails required by the SoC and
-the commonly used peripherals.
