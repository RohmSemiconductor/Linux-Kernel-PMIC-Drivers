Subject: [PATCH 2/4] regulator: bd718x7: Go to SNVS instead of READY

If crucial-to-boot regulators are not controlled by SW
we can utilize SNVS state as a state followed by reset.
So let's go back relying on defaults for poweroff state
transitions. Eg - if HW default is used (boot does not
change states) we go to SNVS after all other resets except
the watchdog reset.
