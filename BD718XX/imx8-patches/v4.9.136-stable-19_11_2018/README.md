# ROHM bd718x7 PMIC. i.MX8 specific set of patches

This patch set backports the ROHM BD718x7 PMIC driver on top of
linux stable kernel version 4.9.136. (Patches 1-19 + patch 22)

Patches 20 and 21 change the community driver to work for powering
NXP i.MX8 processor as explained in data-sheet. This means following
changes compared to plain community driver:

The main benefit is that patch series allows PMIC to transition to SNVS
state when PMIC_ON_REQ or power-button are used to suspend the system.
SNVS state on i.MX8 is power saving state where only SNVS domain stays
powered. Using this state with BD71837/BD71847 is not straightforward
because when SNVS is reached after poweroff state, the regulators with
SW control bit enabled will stay unpowered. Thus if any boot critical
regulator has SW control enabled the system fails to boot if SNVS is used.
Community driver emphasizes giving full control over regulators to SW and
thus always transitions to READY state instead of SNVS. This is not optimal
with i.MX8 because in READY state also SNVS domain is unpowered.

Patch 0020 disables SW enable/disable control from all other regulators
except buck3 and buck4 - which are not boot critical on i.MX8
systems (typically connected to GPU and VPU) and which may provide
remarkable power savings when disabled.

Patch 0021 allows user to specify HW run level (RUN, IDLE, SUSPEND)
specific voltages for DVS bucks.

This patch series was created on top of linux-stabe tree tag 2.9.136
at NOV 19 2018.

the patches.
