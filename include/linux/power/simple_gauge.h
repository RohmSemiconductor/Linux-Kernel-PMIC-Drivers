 * struct simple_gauge_ops - fuel-gauge operations
 *
 * @is_relaxed:		return true if battery is at relaxed state. Update
 *			rex_volt to contain measured relaxed battery voltage.
 * @get_temp:		return the battery temperature in tenths of a degree C.
 * @get_uah_from_full:	some chargers can provide CC value change since battery
 *			was last charged full. This value can be used by
 *			sw-gauge when correcting CC based on battery full
 *			status. This function should return charge lost since
 *			battery was last load full. Units in uAh.
 * @get_uah:		return current charge as measured by coulomb counter in
 *			uAh
 * @update_cc_uah:	Update CC by given charge in uAh
 * @get_cycle:		get battery cycle for age compensation
 * @set_cycle:		some batteries/chargers rely on user-space to store the
 *			cycle infomration over reset. Those drivers can
 *			implement the set_cycle callback which user-space can
 *			use to set the stored battery cycle after reset.
 * @get_sys:		get the current system voltage in uV. Used for
 *			IC specific low-voltage SOC correction.
 * @get_soc_by_ocv:	setups which do not store the OCV/SOC information in
 *			standard battery_info can implement this function to
 *			compute SOC based on OCV. SOC should be returned as
 *			units of 0.1%
 * @get_ocv_by_soc:	setups which do not store the OCV/SOC information in
 *			standard battery_info can implement this function to
 *			compute OCV based on SOC. NOTE: Soc is provided to
 *			the function in units of 0.1% to improve accuracy.
 * @age_correct_cap:	batteries/devices with more complicated aging
 *			correction than constant uAh times battery cycles
 *			can implement this to adjust capacity based on battery
 *			cycles. For constant aging use degrade_cycle_uah
 *			in desc.
 * @temp_correct_cap:	batteries/devices with more complicated temperature
 *			correction than ranges of temperatures with constant
 *			change uah/degree C can implement this to adjust
 *			capacity based on battery temperature.
 *			For temperature ranges with constant change uAh/degree
 *			use temp_dgr and amount_of_temp_dgr at desc.
 * @calibrate:		many devices implement coulomb counter calibration
 *			(for example by measuring ADC offset pins shorted).
 *			Such devices can implement this function for periodical
 *			calibration.
 * @suspend_calibrate:	Many small capacity battery devices or devices which
 *			spend long time MCU suspended can benefit from
 *			starting the calibration when entering to suspend. Such
 *			devices can implement this callback to initiaite
 *			calibration when entering to suspend
 * @zero_cap_adjust: IC specific SOC estimation adjustment to be performed
 *			when battery is approaching empty.

/**
 * struct simple_gauge_desc - fuel gauge description

 * with coulomb counter. OCV - SOC table and iterative polling / error
 * correction) provided by the simple_gauge framework must be described by the
 * simple_gauge_desc prior registration to the simple_gauge framework.
 *
 * @name:		Identifying name for gauge (Is this needed?)
 * @degrade_cycle_uah:	constant lost capacity / battery cycle in uAh.
 * @amount_of_temp_dgr:	amount of temperature ranges provided in temp_dgr
 * @temp_dgr:		ranges of constant lost capacity / temperature degree
 *			in uAh. Ranges should be sorted in asecnding order by
 *			temperature_floor.
 * @poll_interval:	time interval in mS at which this fuel gauge iteration
 *			loop for volage polling and coulomb counter corrections
 *			should be ran.
 * @calibrate_interval:	time interval in mS at which this IC should be
 *			calibrated.
 * @designed_cap:	designed battery capacity in uAh. Can be given here if
 *			not available via batinfo.
 * @allow_set_cycle:	Allow userspace to set cached battery cycle. If no HW
 *			access is required when new battery cycle value is set
 *			the driver can omit set_cycle callback and just set
 *			this to true.
 * @clamp_soc:		Set true tonot allow computed SOC to increase if state
 *			is discharging.
 * @cap_adjust_volt_threshold: some systems want to apply extra computation
 *			to estimate battery capacity when voltage gets close
 *			to system limit in order to avoid shut-down for as long
 *			as possible. Such ICs can set this limit and optionally
 *			implement zero_cap_adjust callback.
 * @system_min_voltage:	ICs using the cap_adjust_volt_threshold and no
 *			zero_cap_adjust call-back should set this voltage
 *			to Vsys which correspond empty battery situation.
