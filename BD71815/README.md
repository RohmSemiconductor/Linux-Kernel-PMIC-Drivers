# ROHM Power Management IC BD71815 Linux device drivers.

A Linux driver for the ROHM BD71815 Power Management IC is available here.
Please note that this driver has been originally written for an early Linux 4.9
kernel and has not been actively maintained. Here we have a port to the more
recent Linux v.4.9.99 - but this port has not been fully tested. Please treat
this as a reference design only.

Please find the driver ported on Linux v4.9.99 [here](https://github.com/RohmSemiconductor/Linux-Kernel-PMIC-Drivers/tree/v4.9.99-BD71815AGW)

This driver has support for
* MFD
* GPIO
* power-supply
* regulators
* RTC
