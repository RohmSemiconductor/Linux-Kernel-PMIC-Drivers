  This module is part of the ROHM BD96801 MFD device. For more details
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd96801-pmic.yaml.

  The regulator controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
  on the device tree.

  Regulator nodes should be named to BUCK_<number> and LDO_<number>.
  The valid names for BD96801 regulator nodes are
  BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK3, BUCK4, LDO5, LDO6, LDO7
