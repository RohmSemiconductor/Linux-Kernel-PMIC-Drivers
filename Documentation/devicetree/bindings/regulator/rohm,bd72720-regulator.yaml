  This module is part of the ROHM BD72720 MFD device. For more details
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd72720-pmic.yaml.

  The regulator controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
  on the device tree.

  Regulator nodes should be named to BUCK_<number> and LDO_<number>.
  The valid names for BD72720 regulator nodes are
  buck1, buck2, buck3, buck4, buck5, buck6, buck7, buck8, buck9, buck10
  ldo1, ldo2, ldo3, ldo4, ldo5, ldo6, ldo7, ldo8, ldo9, ldo10, ldo11
