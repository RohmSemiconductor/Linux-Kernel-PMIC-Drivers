# ROHM Power Management IC BD96801 Linux device drivers.

A Linux driver for the ROHM BD96801 Power Management IC is under development.

Development version can be found [here](https://github.com/RohmSemiconductor/Linux-Kernel-PMIC-Drivers/tree/testing-scalable-bd96801-devel) - but it must be treated as work-in-progress. Please note that the branch is not stable and is likely to be rebased - meaning you probably should not work on this branch. Our intention is to collect feedback from the Linux kernel community and further develop this driver when HW interfaces are frozen. Hopefully this will eventually end up in upstream kernel.

This driver has support for
* Regulators
* Watchdog
